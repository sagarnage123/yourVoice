# Copilot Instructions for the `yourVoice` Project

Welcome to the `yourVoice` codebase! This document provides essential guidelines for AI coding agents to be productive in this project. Follow these instructions to understand the architecture, workflows, and conventions specific to this repository.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: The `yourVoice` project aims to [insert project purpose here, e.g., "provide a platform for voice-based communication and analysis"].
- **Architecture**: The project structure and major components are currently unclear due to the absence of source files. Update this section as the codebase evolves.

## Developer Workflows
- **Version Control**: This project uses Git. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to the repository.
- **Build and Test**: Add instructions for building and testing the project once the relevant files are available.
- **Debugging**: Document debugging workflows as the codebase grows.

## Conventions and Patterns
- **File Organization**: Follow a logical structure for organizing files and directories. For example:
  - `src/` for source code
  - `tests/` for test cases
  - `docs/` for documentation
- **Coding Standards**: Adhere to common best practices for clean, maintainable code. Specify project-specific standards as they emerge.

## Integration Points
- **External Dependencies**: Document any external libraries, APIs, or services used in the project.
- **Cross-Component Communication**: Describe how different parts of the system interact as the architecture becomes clearer.

## Examples
- Provide examples of common patterns or workflows in the codebase. For instance:
  - How to add a new feature
  - How to write a test case

## Updating This Document
This document is a living guide. Update it regularly to reflect changes in the codebase, workflows, or conventions.

**Next Steps**: As the codebase evolves, revisit this document to:
1. Add specific details about the architecture and major components.
2. Document build, test, and debugging workflows.
3. Include examples of project-specific patterns and conventions.
