Project Overview

This repository contains a production-grade, college-only web platform that allows students to anonymously share sensitive issues with verified teachers and counsellors.

The platform focuses on mental health, academic, financial, personal, and emotional concerns, enabling students to speak freely without fear of identity exposure.

This is not a demo project. It is designed with real users, real risks, and real responsibility in mind.

Core Objective

Create a safe, trusted communication channel where students can express concerns honestly, while maintaining safety, accountability, and institutional responsibility.

Anonymity Model (Non-Negotiable)

Students are anonymous to:

Teachers

Counsellors

Other students

Only admins can identify a student.

Admin identity access is allowed only in rare, extreme cases:

Harassment or abuse

Repeated suicidal ideation

Serious system misuse

All identity access must be:

Justified

Logged

Rare

Anonymity is a default right, not a privilege.

Safety & Content Boundaries
Allowed

Mental health concerns

Academic stress

Financial issues

Personal or emotional struggles

Honest, raw expression (similar to talking with trusted friends)

Not Allowed

Hate speech

Harassment or threats

Sexual abuse

Spam or coordinated misuse

Expression ≠ Abuse
Honest expression is protected. Abuse is blocked.

Responsibility Boundary

This platform is a support and communication system.

It is not:

Emergency services

Medical or psychological diagnosis

A suicide hotline

AI therapy

Severe cases are escalated to humans, not handled automatically.
